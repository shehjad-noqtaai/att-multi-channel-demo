# AT&T Multi-channel Personalization POC

A Sanity-powered demo showing how **Sanity AI (Agent Actions)** turns a single campaign brief into a full matrix of channel- and segment-specific content variations — generated, previewable, and editable inside Sanity.

> **Build-ready PRD: see [`docs/PRD.md`](./docs/PRD.md)** — self-contained, no external references required. Appendix A–E has copy-pasteable templates for every role.
>
> **Architecture overview: see [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md)**

## The "wow" moment

A marketer writes one brief in an **App SDK app**, clicks _Generate variations_, and Sanity AI produces **12 personalized variations** (3 channels × 4 segments) — each shaped to the channel's format and the segment's brand voice. All 12 are previewable as a live channel × segment matrix inside Sanity Studio with channel-accurate mockups.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20.19
- **npm** (workspaces monorepo)
- A Sanity account with access to project `z6s0fz61` / dataset `production`
- For **Generate variations** (Agent Actions): an editor token with read + write on the dataset
- For **App SDK deploy**: an organization-level token with **Manage SDK Apps** permission (org `oab7ManMj`)

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/demo-repositories/att-personalization.git
cd att-personalization
npm install
```

## Run locally

The monorepo has two frontends that share code from `studio/src/`. Run them in separate terminals.

### Sanity Studio (content editors + Variations tab)

```bash
npm run studio:dev
```

Opens at **http://localhost:3333** (default Sanity dev port). Sign in with your Sanity account when prompted.

From Studio you can:

- Edit campaign briefs, channels, segments, and merge-field registry
- Click **Generate variations** on a `campaignBrief` document (calls live Agent Actions)
- Open the **Variations** tab on a brief to preview the channel × segment matrix

### Campaign Studio (App SDK — marketer-facing app)

```bash
npm run app:dev
```

Opens at **http://localhost:3333** by default (Vite). If Studio is already running, Vite will pick the next free port (e.g. 3334) and print the URL in the terminal.

The App SDK app handles sign-in via `@sanity/sdk-react`. After login you get a brief list, brief editor, generate dialog with progress, and the same variation matrix previews as Studio.

Optional env overrides — copy the example file or use the populated defaults in `.env`:

```bash
cp apps/campaign-studio/.env.example apps/campaign-studio/.env
# already populated: VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=z6s0fz61, VITE_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

### Verify the build

```bash
npm run typecheck   # studio + campaign-studio
npm run test        # vitest in studio (36 unit tests)
npm run studio:build
npm run app:build
```

## Deploy

Both apps deploy to Sanity-hosted URLs. Set `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` in `studio/.env` (see `studio/.env.example`) or export it in your shell.

| App | Directory | Command | Hosted URL |
|-----|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Studio** | `studio/` | `npm run deploy` | https://att-personalization.sanity.studio/ |
| **App SDK** | `apps/campaign-studio/` | `npm run deploy` | https://attcampaignstudio.sanity.studio/ |

### Deploy Studio (schema + bundle)

Studio deploy builds the bundle, deploys the schema, and publishes to Sanity hosting in one step:

```bash
cd studio
export SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=<deploy-studio-or-editor-token>
npm run deploy
```

Schema id is captured in [`studio/SCHEMA_ID.md`](./studio/SCHEMA_ID.md) (`_.schemas.default`). Re-run deploy after any schema change — Agent Actions validates against the deployed schema.

Deploy only the schema (no Studio bundle):

```bash
npm run studio:deploy-schema
```

### Deploy Campaign Studio (App SDK)

Requires an **organization-level** token with **Manage SDK Apps** (a project deploy token is not sufficient):

```bash
cd apps/campaign-studio
export SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=<org-token-with-manage-sdk-apps>
npm run deploy
```

App and org ids are wired in `apps/campaign-studio/sanity.cli.ts`.

### Live smoke test (Agent Actions)

After deploy, verify end-to-end generation with an **editor** token (not deploy-only):

```bash
cd studio
export SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=<editor-token>
npx tsx scripts/smoke.ts
```

Expects seeded brief `brief-spring5g` and writes 12 `contentVariation` documents.

## Stack

Per PRD §Tech stack — implementing agents should confirm exact API shapes against installed versions via the Sanity docs MCP.

- **Studio** — `sanity ^5.30`, React 19, `@sanity/assist ^6`, `@sanity/ui ^3`, `@sanity/image-url ^2`
- **App SDK app** — `@sanity/sdk-react ^2.12`, `@sanity/ui ^3`, React 19
- **Client** — `@sanity/client ^7.20` (≥7.1 required for Agent Actions; `apiVersion: 'vX'` only inside `agentGenerate.ts`)
- **Tests** — `vitest ^2` (pure Node, no jsdom — see PRD Appendix E)

## Workflow

- Feature branch per task → PR to `main` → PM reviews (build/typecheck/test locally) → merge.
- Every scope decision recorded in the spec body with a dated citation, not just chat.

## For implementing agents

- **Read `docs/PRD.md` Appendix A–E first** — schema template, Studio view + null-guarded preview, App SDK Suspense flow, `@sanity/ui` do/don't, vitest convention.
- When a Sanity API surface is uncertain (Agent Actions, App SDK), verify against the docs MCP (`search_docs` / `read_docs`) — the PRD notes which surfaces are evolving (`vX`, `@sanity/sdk-react`).
- The `generate/` core is **framework-agnostic** — never import `sanity` or React there.
